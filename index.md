Welcome to Naoya Ozawa's music portfolio. I will post the scores for some of my compositions and arrangements. Some of these pieces are played by myself on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHl0Jc2CnznF_XmHYugdZw?view_as=subscriber).

# Suite for Piano Solo (2008?/2018?)

* [SCORE[PDF]](https://github.com/civickomachi/Suite_for_Piano_Solo/blob/master/buildfiles/Suite_for_Piano_Solo.pdf)

1. Andante
1. Allegro con fuoco
1. Allegretto

A re-transcription of three improvisations. The original recordings have been lost.

The Andante is a simple variation based on the "Canon progression". It can also be seen as a trio form. The Allegro con fuoco is made up from an agitative main riff and several melancholic episodes. The Allegretto is my first attempt to combine the popular music form (ABC-ABC-D-ABC) with the classical sonata form.
